[NEED TO INCLUDE DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT] 


Folders: 
- `Code` contains scripts to run simulations and report results(i.e., compute and display performance measures).
- `Functions` contains functions that are implemented when running simulations (e.g., generate data).
- `Output` contains subfolders holding simulation output information (e.g., estimates per run) & results (e.g., performance measures).

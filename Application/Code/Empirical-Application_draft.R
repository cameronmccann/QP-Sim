#
# Notes:
#   To-Do:
#     + increase number of clusters to all of those greater or equal to 5 (Liu email)
#       - write RE mediator & outcome code 
#       - create bootstrap function
#       - address model convergence issues: with PS (& maybe mediator & outcome) 
#     + I had model convergence issues with 15 clusters (cs: 41-81 students; N = 742). So I will attempt to increase the number of clusters 
# 
#     + Obtain variables names from codebook
#       - School ID
# 
#   Next: 
#     + 
#     + Figure out how to get covariate balance for all models on 1 visual (like Chang et al. article) 
# 
#   Done: 
# 
#     + get weights & figure out how to incorporate them properly into the analysis 
#     + create rough draft of code to run analyses 
#     + 
#     + Note. pg 14 of 21600-User_guide.pdf provides weights 
#     + Multilevel Model sample weight example on pg 43 of 21600-User_guide.pdf

## “you have a lot to be proud of,” (H3SP20)
## “you like yourself just the way you are,” (H3SP21)

# used "Do you agree or disagree that you feel you are doing things just about right?" (H3SP22) as replacement 
### with responses on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree) (reverse coded), 
## and “How often was the following been true over the past week? You felt that you were just as good as other people,” (H3SP7)
### with responses ranging from 0 (never or rarely) to 3 (most of the time or all of the time). Higher scores indicate greater self-esteem.28
